# Time Series Forecast Study with Python: Monthly Sales of French Champagne
“A **time series** is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.”

**Seasonality**: Seasonality is the presence of variations at regular intervals of time in time series data. It exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors. The interval is generally less than a year such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly etc.

**Trend**: In Time Series analysis trend is a gradual shift towards relatively lower or higher values over a long period of time.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to forecast the monthly sales of French champagne with Python.

### Environment
This tutorial assumes an installed and working SciPy environment and dependencies, including:

* SciPy
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* scikit-learn
* statsmodels

### Problem Description
The problem is to predict the number of monthly sales of champagne for the Perrin Freres label (named for a region in France).

The dataset provides the number of monthly sales of champagne from January 1964 to September 1972, or just under 10 years of data.

The values are a count of millions of sales and there are 105 observations.

The dataset is credited to Makridakis and Wheelwright, 1989.
